# rustlings ü¶Ä‚ù§Ô∏è

Greetings and welcome to `rustlings` 5.2.1 version. This project contains small exercises to get you used to reading and writing Rust code. This includes reading and responding to compiler messages!


Alternatively, for a first-time Rust learner, there are several other resources:

- [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/index.html) - The most comprehensive resource for learning Rust, but a bit theoretical sometimes. You will be using this along with Rustlings!
- [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html) - Learn Rust by solving little exercises! It's almost like `rustlings`, but online
